### ABSTRACT

This research leverages machine learning to investigate predictors of depression among U.S. adults (ages 18-64) with intellectual disabilities, utilizing data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) involving 425 participants. Depression was assessed based on self-reported diagnoses. The study employed XGBoost for predictive modeling, incorporating a range of demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related factors, and used SHAP for interpretability of the model's outputs [accuracy: 69.4%, precision: 71.6%, recall: 95.1%]. Significant predictors of depression identified were age, number of physical conditions, perceived physical health, sex, and being non-Hispanic white. These findings underscore the importance of tailored interventions and policies for addressing mental health needs in individuals with intellectual disabilities.
